\section{Choosing a Client Process} % Sub-section

Among our initial ideas for clients and problems, we focused on writing.
Our initial problem was in the realm of collaborative writing techniques for technical, novel, and story telling writers.
Given client scheduling problems, we had to abandon this idea.
Our next client in the writing domain we chose was the Virginia Tech Writing Center (WC), and the Assistant Director Jennifer Lawrence.
She has served in this role for 7 years, and her extensive knowledge alongside positional status makes her the ideal candidate within the WC to initially contact and get organizational information, as well as follow communication for project details.
